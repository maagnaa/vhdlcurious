# 2_mux2: 4-vector multiplexer

You are on your own now!  
*(Not really, **DO** ask for hints if stuck!)*  

Your task now is to think what you need to do in order to create a multiplexer that has 4 inputs instead of 2.

* What changes do you need to make to the entity?
* How does the architecture of a 4:1 mux differ from the architecture you made for the 2:1 mux?

Implement and simulate!
