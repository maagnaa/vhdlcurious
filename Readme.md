# Repository Overview

I will number the various components in the order I want you to work through them. Each component will get their own folder for reasons that will become aparent as we progress, so some folders will contain a higher workload than others and that is cool as a cucumbah.  

But anyways, it is good heckin practice to stick to a folder structure, and we will be sticking to the following

- x_module_name/  
  - doc/
  - script/
  - src/
  - tb/
  - README.md

## IMPORTANT

- **ALWAYS** read the README.md for each submodule.
- If I make a doc folder, YOU BET you are supposed to use the included documentation **while you are working through the exercise**. There will be important information in there that will make your life WAY easier!

## 1_smoldrill

Smoldrill is literally a smol drill, where you can get familiarized again with the basics of a VHDL module, its corresponding testbench and general VHDL syntax basics. 

## 2_mux & 3_mux

Everybody needs multiplexers, and so do we! You are going to make some multiplexers and simulate them so we know we can use them later on. :)
